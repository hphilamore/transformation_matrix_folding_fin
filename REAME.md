A model of the fin folding kinematics. 

The profile of each fin ray was represented as an isosceles triangle with the smallest angle $\alpha$ and the shortest side length $a$. 

Each hinge, $i$ was represented as a revolute joint, $q_i$. 

The axis of rotation of each joint $q_i$ is aligned with the rotation axis of hinge $i$, and the position of $q_i$ is on the fin edge, distal to the fin base, $b$. The joints $q$, are connected in series by rigid links of length $a$. 

The $z$ axis of the base reference frame is aligned with the axis of rotation of $q_i$, and the $x$ axis is parallel to the face of the fin ray connecting hinges $q_i$ and $q_{i+1}$. 

A 3D homogeneous transformation matrix $A^i_{i+1}$, is used to compute the position and orientation of $q_{i+1}$ with respect to the previous hinge $q_i$, denoted by a three-vector $\mathbf{p}^i_{i+1}$ (coordinates $q_{i+1}$ with respect to $q_{i}$) and a 3 Ã— 3 rotation matrix $R^i_{i+1}$. 

The transformation matrix $A^i_{i+1}$ is the product of four basic transformations: First, $R_y(\beta)$ rotates the coordinate axes $x,z$ by angle $\beta= \frac{\alpha}{2}$; then $Tx(a)$ then translates axes $x', z'$ by length $a$; next $R_y(\gamma)$ rotates coordinate axes $x'',z''$ by angle $\gamma= \frac{\alpha}{2}$; finally $R_z(\theta)$ rotates coordinate axes $x''',y'''$ about $z'''$ by joint angle $\theta$. 

\begin{equation}
\adjustbox{max width=7.8cm}{$
\begin{aligned}
A^i_{i+1} & = R_{y}(\beta)  T_{x}(d) R_{y}(\gamma) R_{z}(\theta) \\
& = \begin{bmatrix}
R^i_{i+1} & \mathbf{p}^i_{i+1} \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \\
& = \begin{bmatrix}
c\theta c(\beta+\gamma) & s\theta c(\beta+\gamma) & s(\beta+\gamma) & a c\beta\\[6pt]
s \theta & c\theta & 0 & 0\\[6pt]
-s(\beta+\gamma)c \theta & s \theta s(\beta+\gamma) & c(\beta+\gamma) & -as \beta\\[6pt]
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$}
\label{eq:transformation_matrix}
\end{equation}

where $s=\sin$ and $c=\cos$. 

It follows that the position and orientation of any hinge $j$, with respect to hinge $i$ can be found by $A^i_{j} = A^i_{i+1} A^{i+1}_{i+2}...A^{j-2}_{j-1} A^{i-1}_{j}$

A wireframe model of the folded fin was generated by drawing each hinge, to connects each joint $q$, to the fin base, $b$.
